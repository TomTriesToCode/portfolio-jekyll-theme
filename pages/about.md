# Tom's Portfolio

I am a Brit living in Canada, trying to spend as much time running, climbing and skiing as possible. Working in a climbing gym as my regular job allows me a decent flexibility to take on mathematics tuition work, which I always consider my primary occupation, and to go on trips to some of the amazing places accessible with a 'short' (by North American standards) drive of a few thousand kilometers down the Pacific Coast!
As I settle to life here, I find myself looking for a more stable career at some point in the medium term future, hence my enrollment in this course and in various coding courses online. I will miss the free time I get currently but I am lucky enough to live and play in the same place, so weekends and evenings will be plenty!
